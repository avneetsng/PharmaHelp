# PharmaHelp

This is the website made for a Hackathon on the Health and Care Field.

### Problem Statement
Nowadays, we have a lot of laboratories that offer us various medical tests but with more options, there is an increase in entropy. There is a need of an app that provides cheapest, safe certified and nearest laboratories with the availability of the tests they provide. Same is the case with pharmacies.<Br><Br>

### About the labs
A medical laboratory or clinical laboratory is a laboratory where clinical pathology tests are carried out on clinical specimens to obtain information about the health of a patient to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Clinical Medical laboratories are an example of applied science, as opposed to research laboratories that focus on basic science, such as found in some academic institutions.

### What this WebApp will do?
1.) Sort the name, location, rating and rates of all the medical tests done by respective laboratory .<Br>
2.) Compare each test for all the labs based on the rate charged to perform a specific test, the location of the lab and the ambience of the lab. <Br>
3.)This will help everyone to know which lab is providing best facility and which lab is providing the test on cheap rates. So a person who cannot spend much money but the test is necessary to be performed he can see the analysis and go to the lab which suits him/her the best. <Br>
4.)The patient can upload the pdf/image of the report and we’ll analyse it for them which will inform them about what they’re suffering from.<Br><Br>

P.S. Each lab will be required to upload their proof of certification on the web app so that we can know about the authorized lab.

### About Pharmacy!!
A pharmacy (also called "drugstore" in American English or "community pharmacy" or "chemist's" in Commonwealth English) is a retail shop which provides prescription drugs, among other products. At the pharmacy, a pharmacist oversees the fulfillment of medical prescriptions and is available to give advice on their offerings of over-the-counter drugs. A typical pharmacy would be in the commercial area of a community. Basically a pharmacy provides three types of drugs:<br>
1.) Homeopathic    <Br>
2.) Allopathic<Br>
3.) Ayurvedic<Br>
  <Br>
    
### What will this web app do?
1.) Fetch the data of all the pharmacies <br>
2.) Comparison on the basis of rates and availability of a particular drug. <br>
3.) The people who cannot afford much can see the statistics and then can go to that particular shop to buy the drugs. So at all the money of the person gets saved and even his/her time too.<br>
P.S. Each pharmacy will be required to upload their proof of certification on the web app so that we can know about the authorized pharmacies.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
  1.) Heroku<Br>
  2.) Django<Br>
  3.) Postgresql<Br>
  4.) AWS<Br>
  5.) Cloudinary<Br>
  6.) SKLearn<Br>
  7.) ECMAScript<Br>
  8.) CSS<Br>
  9.) Serialiser<Br>
  <Br>
    
  ### What’s special about the app?
1.) While thinking about this we also have a special idea basically for women. We all know that in today’s time girls are not able to express their feelings that is they are not able to discuss with anyone about what actually is going in their mind.<Br>
2.) So basically the idea is that their will be an option “Get a doctor”. As you click on it you will be redirected to a chat app where you can openly discuss about your problem with our specialist. The special thing about this will be that this service will be completely free.<br><Br>
  
### Future Scope
1.) We will train our model so that it gives more precise results about the patients report.<br>
2.) We’ll tie up with the lab so that the patient can book an appointment to that particular lab using our WebApp directly.
