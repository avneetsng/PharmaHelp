### Problem Statement
Nowadays, we have a lot of laboratories that offer us various medical tests but with more options, there is an increase in entropy. There is a need of an app that provides cheapest, safe certified and nearest laboratories with the availability of the tests they provide. Same is the case with pharmacies.<Br><Br>

### About the labs
A medical laboratory or clinical laboratory is a laboratory where clinical pathology tests are carried out on clinical specimens to obtain information about the health of a patient to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Clinical Medical laboratories are an example of applied science, as opposed to research laboratories that focus on basic science, such as found in some academic institutions.

### What this WebApp will do?
1.) Sort the name, location, rating and rates of all the medical tests done by respective laboratory .<Br>
2.) Compare each test for all the labs based on the rate charged to perform a specific test, the location of the lab and the ambience of the lab. <Br>
3.)This will help everyone to know which lab is providing best facility and which lab is providing the test on cheap rates. So a person who cannot spend much money but the test is necessary to be performed he can see the analysis and go to the lab which suits him/her the best. <Br>
4.)The patient can upload the pdf/image of the report and we’ll analyse it for them which will inform them about what they’re suffering from.<Br><Br>

P.S. Each lab will be required to upload their proof of certification on the web app so that we can know about the authorized lab.
